# IdrisCT

A collection of type definitions for formal proofs in category theory. Everything is a type; nothing is a record type.

## Getting Started

For global installation use:

```
idris --install idrisCT.ipkg
```

from the root directory of the repo.

Otherwise simply copy the file `definitions.idr` into the root of your project.

In either case include using

```
import Categories
```

immediately after declaring your module.
